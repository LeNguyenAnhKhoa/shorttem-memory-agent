(Computer work, video calls, creative work, etc.)\n\n**Budget:**\n- What's your overall budget for the setup?\n\nLet me know these details and I can provide tailored recommendations!"

Here's what I recommend:\n\n**Essential setup (~$1500):**\n- Standing desk: $300-500 (UPLIFT or Flexispot)\n- Ergonomic chair: $300-400 (Secretlab or HON)\n- Monitor: $300-400 (27\" 4K for coding)\n- Keyboard & mouse: $150-200\n- Desk lamp: $50-100\n\n**Remaining ~$500 for:**\n- Monitor arm\n- Cable management\n- Webcam for meetings\n- Plants/decor\n\nDo you have any existing equipment to work with? And do you prefer Mac or Windows setup?"

Updated plan:\n\n**Revised budget allocation ($2000):**\n\n**Desk setup ($400-600):**\n- Standing desk with good cable management\n- Consider one with USB-C hub built-in for MacBook\n\n**Display setup ($600-800):**\n- 27\" 4K monitor (LG 27UK850 or Dell U2720Q) - $400-500\n- Thunderbolt dock (CalDigit TS3+) - $250-300\n- Monitor arm - $50\n\n**Peripherals ($200-300):**\n- Mechanical keyboard (Keychron K2) - $80-100\n- Magic Trackpad or quality mouse - $50-100\n- Webcam (Logitech C920) - $70\n\n**Remaining for comfort/aesthetics ($300-400):**\n- Good lighting (ring light or desk lamp)\n- Plants\n- Sound panels if needed for calls\n\nThis setup would give you a clean, productive MacBook workstation.

            "content": "Limited natural light is common in spare bedrooms. Good lighting is crucial for both productivity and video calls. Here's my recommendation:\n\n**Layered lighting approach:**\n\n**1. Task lighting (desk):**\n- BenQ ScreenBar (~$110) - attaches to monitor, no desk space used\n- Adjustable color temperature for day/night\n\n**2. Ambient lighting:**\n- Floor lamp with warm bulbs for general room light\n- Smart bulbs (Philips Hue) - adjust throughout day\n\n**3. Video call lighting:**\n- Small ring light or key light\n- Position to face you, not behind\n\n**Budget tip:** Start with the BenQ ScreenBar - it's a game-changer for developers. You can add ambient lighting later.\n\n**Also consider:**\n- Light-colored walls reflect light better\n- Mirror opposite the window to bounce light\n- Avoid glossy screens (your MacBook is matte, which is good)\n\nDoes the small window face north, south, east, or west? This affects how much natural light you'll get during work hours."

This changes my chair recommendation - even if you have one from your old office, it might be worth reconsidering if it's not ergonomically optimal.\n\n**For your back, prioritize:**\n\n**If your current chair isn't supportive:**\n- Herman Miller Aeron (used: $500-700) - gold standard for back support\n- Steelcase Leap - excellent lumbar support\n- Add a lumbar support pillow to your current chair (~$30-50)\n\n**Desk ergonomics:**\n- Standing desk is ESSENTIAL for you - alternate sitting/standing\n- Monitor at eye level (arm is critical)\n- Keyboard tray to keep wrists neutral\n\n**Additional for back health:**\n- Anti-fatigue mat for standing (~$40)\n- Footrest for sitting (~$30)\n- Set reminders to switch positions every 30-45 min\n\n**North-facing window note:**\n- Consistent, soft light (no harsh direct sun)\n- But will be dimmer overall\n- Definitely invest in good artificial lighting\n\nWhat's your current chair model? I can assess if it's adequate for your back situation or if we should reallocate budget."
